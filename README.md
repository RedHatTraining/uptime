# [📈 Live Status](https://RedHatTraining.github.io/uptime): <!--live status--> **🟩 All systems operational**

This repository contains the open-source uptime monitor and status page for [Red Hat Training](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training), powered by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).

With [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org), you can get your own unlimited and free uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by a GitHub repository. We use [Issues](https://github.com/RedHatTraining/uptime/issues) as incident reports, [Actions](https://github.com/RedHatTraining/uptime/actions) as uptime monitors, and [Pages](https://RedHatTraining.github.io/uptime) for the status page.
